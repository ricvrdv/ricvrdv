## HI, I'M RICARDO üëã
I'm a software developer currently focused on C, C++, Linux, and Bash scripting.

I originally studied Biology and later specialized in Bioinformatics, which is where I got into coding through Python ‚Äî and I‚Äôve been hooked ever since.

Currently studying at 42 Porto, I'm fully focused on tech, always learning, and always looking for interesting problems to solve. I enjoy building things that are clean ‚úÖ, efficient üìä, and actually work ‚öôÔ∏è

Always up for new challenges, cool projects, and learning something unexpected along the way!

## MOST RECENT PROJECT
[Cub3D](https://github.com/ricvrdv/cub3d):
- A simplified version of the classic Wolfenstein 3D ray-casting engine built from scratch in C.
- It is a foundational group project in the 42 curriculum that teaches graphics programming and collaboration.
- Mastering the secrets of `git` for effective version control.
